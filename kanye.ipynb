    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple natural language processing (NLP) project that analyzes three Kanye West albums. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project serves four purposes:\n",
    "1. Identify significant words within each album\n",
    "2. Provide a quantitative measure of similarity between the tracks within each album\n",
    "3. Provide a quantitative measure of similarity between the three albums\n",
    "4. Obtain a sense of how Kanye West has (or has not) evolved through the years in regards to his use of vocabulary. The albums selected are exactly six years apart, spanning a total of 12 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please be advised**: Explicit content exists ahead! Profanity and offensive language used by Kanye West in his lyrics were not excluded in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Albums used:\n",
    "- Life of Pablo (2016)\n",
    "- My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010)\n",
    "- The College Dropout (2004)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Only lyrics vocalized by Kanye West himself were included in the analysis. Features from other artists were excluded to minimize deviations and uphold the integrity of the analysis as much as possible. As a result, multiple tracks may seem heavily reduced in terms of lyrical length. Additionally, tracks entirely without Kanye West vocals were completely excluded as well.\n",

    "Lyrics were retrieved from Genius Media Group Inc. at http://www.genius.com\n",

Because the shape of the previous data frames were different between albums, new data frames were created by first making each album into a single collection (versus a list of tracks) and re-vectorizing them to obtain a new bag-of-words. A bar graph is provided for easy visualization. Bars that reach a value of 1.0 is due to a comparison to itself."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Some simple findings:\n",
    "1. Kanye West showed high similarity across his albums over the span of 12 years.\n",
    "2. Kanye West uses the word \"love\" significantly in TLOP and MBDTF, but not in TCD (one of his earliest albums).\n",
    "3. The word \"im\" scored relatively high in all three albums, especially in MBDTF where it scored the highest. This could be a reflection of his egotistic nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this was only a simple and introductory analysis on the vocabulary used by Kanye West, the similarity results are actually, in some ways, weak. Better methods for data cleansing, stop-word matching, and bag-of-words collecting would surely tune the results more efficiently.  For example:\n",
    "- The highest word significance values were only within the track and the album so the information can be misleading.\n",
    "- Only three albums were used so the data sample is quite small.\n",
    "- It's rap music. Artists are seen \"good\" based on the production of the song and how people connect to it, not so much on the choice of words (not going to dismiss vocabulary completely, though).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, this analysis formed a basic foundation to build upon. From here, other types of analysis can be done, such as a comparison amongst Kanye West's entire discography and a comparison between him and other artists. Furthermore, sentiment analysis and thematic analysis could integrate with an observation of the time period that the album was recorded in to get a sense of what may have influenced Kanye West's vocabulary decisions."
